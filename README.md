# Week-8-Pentesting-Live-targets

Green target

Tried vulnerability site: Green
When I enter a known user's id and any password, the error message is "log in was unsuccesful" in Bold. If any other random user is given in the ID portion, the error message is not in bold. This is due to the css class to be 'failure' in the first case and 'failed' in the latter case.

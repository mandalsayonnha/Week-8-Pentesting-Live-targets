Challenge 0
Green target

Tried vulnerability site: Green
When I enter a known user's id and any password, the error message is "log in was unsuccesful" in Bold. If any other random user is given in the ID portion, the error message is not in bold. This is due to the css class to be 'failure' in the first case and 'failed' in the latter case.

Challenge 1
Tried vulnerability site: Red
In the 'Find a Salesperson' link, you can see different salespersons. If you click on any one, you see their detilas. Note teh url contains the id number. I tried with different id numbers and found that 10 and 11 lead to two people called esty McTesterson and Lazy Lazyman who are not visible in the other two target sites. These leads to the IDOR vulnerability.
